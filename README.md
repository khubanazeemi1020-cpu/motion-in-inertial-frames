# Motion in Inertial Frames

## Project Overview
This repository contains all files and resources related to the study of motion in inertial frames of reference. The project explores the principles of Newtonian mechanics, including the analysis of forces, velocity, and acceleration in different inertial reference frames. It aims to provide a clear understanding of how motion is observed from various perspectives and how physical laws apply consistently across inertial frames.

## Repository Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Reports/**  
  Contains the main project report detailing theoretical concepts, derivations, and explanations of motion in inertial frames.

- **Diagrams/**  
  Includes illustrations, free-body diagrams, and visual aids showing motion and forces in different frames of reference.

- **Data/**  
  Contains experimental or calculated data used to support the analysis and examples.

- **README.md**  
  This file providing project overview and guidance for users.
